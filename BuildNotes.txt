-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Start
-----------
  Set the EDK_TOOLS_PATH to be the root directory of the tools (the root
  directory contains the Bin\ directory.)

Supported build targets
-----------------------

all				- Incremental Build of all C based tools. This is the default target
clean     - Clean intermediate files
cleanall  - Clean all generated files and directories during build

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools in Python
---------------
* Convert Python source to exe file
  The tools written in Python can be coverted into executable program which can 
  be executed without installing a Python interpreter. 

  For Windows and Linux, the convertion tool package is called cx_Freeze, its
  home page is:

		http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/

	If you have installed cx_Freeze at c:\cx_Freeze-3.0.3. Use following command
  lines to convert MyBuild.py to MyBuild.exe (note this is an example, there is
  no MyBuild Python project in the BaseTools\Python tree.

    set PYTHONPATH=<BaseToolsDirPath>\Source\Python
  	c:\cx_Freeze-3.0.3\FreezePython.exe --include-modules=encodings.cp437,encodings.gbk,encodings.utf_16,encodings.utf_8 --install-dir=.\mybuild MyBuild.py

	The generated .exe (and .dll) files are put in "mybuild" subdirectory.

  The following is a real example with the BuildTools/trunk/BaseTools project 
  installed in: C:\Work\BaseTools

  
  C:\Work\BaseTools\Source\Python> set PYTHONPATH=C:\Work\BaseTools\Source\Python
  C:\Work\BaseTools\Source\Python> c:\cx_Freeze-3.0.3\FreezePython.exe --include-modules=encodings.cp437,encodings.gbk,encodings.utf_16,encodings.utf_8 --install-dir=C:\Work\BaseTools\Bin\Win32 build\build.py
